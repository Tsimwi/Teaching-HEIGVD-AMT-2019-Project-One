### Introduction

Welcome on our AMT project. The main objective of this is to apply the patterns and techniques presented during the lectures, and to create a simple multi-tiered application in Java EE.

### Requirements

You'll need to have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your machine in order to launch the containers. You will also need `maven` and `python` to generate a .war file and run the scripts.

### Build the application

The following script will launch the test environment, make all tests, populate the database, build the production containers and launch the site :

```bash
$ ./launch_project.sh
```
